# Anonymity Module

## Privacy & Anonymity Enhancements

This module provides comprehensive privacy and anonymity features to protect user identity and prevent traffic analysis.

### Features

- **Traffic Obfuscation** (`traffic_obfuscation.rs`) - Disguise traffic patterns to prevent fingerprinting

- **Timing Attack Protection** (`timing_protection.rs`) - Add random delays to prevent timing correlation

- **Connection Mixing** (`connection_mixing.rs`) - Pool and randomize connection handling

- **Metadata Scrubbing** (`metadata_scrubbing.rs`) - Remove identifying headers and server signatures

- **Anti-Correlation Measures** (`anti_correlation.rs`) - Prevent linking of different requests from same user
