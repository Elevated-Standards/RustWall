# 🦀 RustWall - Advanced Firewall and Security System 🛡️

RustWall is a comprehensive Rust-based security solution that provides advanced firewall capabilities, DDoS protection, CAPTCHA verification, and specialized security features for Tor networks and privacy-focused applications. Built using Axum and Tera templating, it offers a robust, modular security layer for your applications.

## ❓ What Problems Does RustWall Solve?

- 🤖 **Automated Bot Prevention**: Advanced CAPTCHA system with analog clock challenges that effectively block automated scripts and bots without relying on JavaScript.
- 🛡️ **DDoS Protection**: Comprehensive DDoS mitigation including rate limiting, IP blocking, and traffic analysis to prevent service outages.
- 🔒 **Privacy & Anonymity**: Advanced anonymity features including traffic obfuscation, timing attack protection, and anti-correlation measures.
- 🌐 **Tor Network Security**: Specialized security features for .onion services including circuit analysis and rendezvous point protection.
- 🔍 **Content Security**: JavaScript sanitization, metadata removal, and fingerprinting protection.
- 🚨 **Operational Security**: Emergency shutdown capabilities, warrant canary systems, and comprehensive audit logging.
- 🌍 **Network Integration**: Advanced Tor integration with multi-onion management and steganographic channels.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

### 📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austinsonger/rustwall.git
cd rustwall
```

Build and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

By default, the server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the `Config` struct in `src/config.rs` to adjust settings such as:

- ⏲️ Session timeout
- 🚦 Rate limiting thresholds
- 🌐 Allowed origins

## 📝 Usage

### 🖥️ CAPTCHA System

Visit `http://localhost:8080/captcha` to see the analog clock CAPTCHA in action.

### 🔗 API Endpoints

#### CAPTCHA API
- `POST /api/captcha/new` – Generate a new CAPTCHA challenge
- `POST /api/captcha/verify` – Verify a user's response

#### Security API
- `GET /api/security/status` – Get system security status
- `POST /api/security/emergency-shutdown` – Trigger emergency shutdown
- `GET /api/security/canary` – Get warrant canary status

Example requests:

```bash
# Generate new CAPTCHA
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/captcha/new

# Check security status
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/security/status

# Get warrant canary
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/security/canary
```

### 🧩 Module Integration

Each security module can be enabled/disabled independently:

```rust
use rustwall::{
    TorSecurityManager,
    AnonymityManager,
    ContentSecurityManager,
    OperationalManager
};

// Initialize security managers
let tor_security = TorSecurityManager::new()?;
let anonymity = AnonymityManager::new()?;
let content_security = ContentSecurityManager::new()?;
let operational = OperationalManager::new()?;
```
